    <h2>Rhodes Piano</h2>
    <p class="one">
        The Rhodes piano is an electro-mechanical piano,
        invented by Harold Rhodes during the fifties and later manufactured in a number of models,
        first in collaboration with Fender and after 1965 by CBS.
        It employs a piano-like keyboard with hammers that hit small metal tines,
        amplified by electromagnetic pickups.

    <h2>Wurlitzer piano</h2>
    <p class="two">
        The Wurlitzer electric piano is an electro-mechanical piano, 
        created by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company of Mississippi. 
        The Wurlitzer company itself never called the instrument an "electric piano",
        instead inventing the phrase "Electronic Piano" and using this as a trademark throughout the production of the instrument. 
        It employs a piano-like keyboard with hammers that hit small metal tines,
        amplified by electromagnetic pickups.
