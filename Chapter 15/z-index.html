    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
    <p>
        In 1817 baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster.
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

        The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse").
        It was made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in park or garden.
