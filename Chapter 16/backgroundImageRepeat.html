    <h2>Magnolia</h2>
    <p>
        Magnolia is an ancient genus. Appearing before bees evolved, the flowers are theorized to have evolved to encourage pollination by beetles.
        To avoid damage from pollinating beetles, the carpels of Magnolia flowers are extremely tough.
        Fossilized specimens of M. acuminata have been found dating to 20 million years ago, and fossils of plants identifiably belonging to the Magnoliaceae date to 95 million years ago. 
        Another aspect of Magnolia considered to represent an ancestral state is that the flower bud is enclosed in a bract rather than in sepals; 
        the perianth parts are undifferentiated and called tepals rather than distinct sepals and petals.
        Magnolia shares the tepal characteristic with several other flowering plants near the base of the flowering plant lineage such as Amborella and Nymphaea (as well as with many more recently derived plants such as Lilium).

    <h2>Ranunculus</h2>
    <p>
        The genus is distributed in Europe, North America and South America. 
        The familiar and widespread buttercup of gardens throughout Northern Europe (and introduced elsewhere) is the creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens, which has extremely tough and tenacious roots.
        Two other species are also widespread, the bulbous buttercup Ranunculus bulbosus and the much taller meadow buttercup Ranunculus acris.
        In ornamental gardens, all three are often regarded as weeds.

    <h2>Tulip</h2>
    <p>
        Tulips (Tulipa) are a genus of spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes (having bulbs as storage organs). 
        The flowers are usually large, showy and brightly coloured, generally red, pink, yellow, or white (usually in warm colours). 
        They often have a different coloured blotch at the base of the tepals (petals and sepals, collectively), internally.
