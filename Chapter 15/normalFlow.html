    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>

        In 1817 baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster.

        The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse").
        It was made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in park or garden.

        The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, then pedals were applied directly to the front wheel.
        This machine was known as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker", since it is wooden structure.
